#Protovore Base-App

This is a starting point.
It's largely ripped off of the ThoughtBot Suspenders gem but with a bit of additional infrastructure to optimize footprint and maintainability.


Next Steps
===========
Now that you have cloned the repo, here's what you should do next:

	1. change the remote git repo destination
	2. $ bundle install
	3. $ compass watch
	4. and run '$ jammit' when you want to see the most up to date file running on local
